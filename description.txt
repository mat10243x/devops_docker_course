For this project I use the course page container and run it on my cloudserver.

Building container with:

sudo docker build . -t coursepage

Running container with:

sudo docker run -d -p 8080:80 coursepage

The coursepage can then accessed via http://212.227.205.190:8080

The Dockerfile was only created because it was required, otherwise the coursepage could just directly executed by:

sudo docker run -d -p 8080:80 devopsdockeruh/coursepage
