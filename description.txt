For this project I use the course page container and run it on my cloudserver.

Building container with:

sudo docker build . -t devops_docker_course

Running container with:

sudo docker compose up

The coursepage can then accessed via http://212.227.205.190:8080

The page preceding the course page was created to show that exercise 3.2 work as the course homepage was used for 1.16 (maybe not the best choice at that time)
